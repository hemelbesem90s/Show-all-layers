# Inkscape Show All Layers Extension

This extension makes all layers in the current Inkscape document visible.

## Functionality

The extension recursively traverses through all layers in the SVG document and sets their `style` attribute to `display:inline;`, making them visible.

## Usage

1.  Install the extension by placing the `show_all_layers.inx` and `show_all_layers.py` files in your Inkscape extensions directory.
2.  Open your SVG document in Inkscape.
3.  Go to `Extensions > Layer > Show All Layers`.
